We will concentrate on more modern models to ensure the safety of EVs.
With more sophisticated metrics, as well as general guidelines for further
 EV identification and diagnosis, to represent an actual relationship between
 cyber attacks and physical response.

Our upcoming effort includes creating defences against coordinated cyberattacks 
on power system control and attacks that affect how the electricity market operates through AGC.

With the use of currently available tools and techniques, future study on the security of data and 
communication in the EV charging infrastructure can be conducted. It should come as no surprise that
 such technologies are now utilised to analyse or assess the security of the wider smart grid or
 a part of it, such as cyber-physical systems. To learn more about related tools, we advise reading
 the material below. Other than the methods listed in Section V-A that are appropriate for technical
 study of particular protocols, simulation of the power network or the communication network, or
 a co-simulation of both, is a frequently used methodology.
